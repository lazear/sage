# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [v0.13.4]
### Fixed
- Bug in mzML parser, where some older specification-compliant mzMLs would not parse. If your mzMLs previously parsed, then there will be no change in behavior. Added a test case

## [v0.13.3]
### Fixed
- Bug in `database.enzyme.restrict` parameter, where `null` values were being overriden with "P" (causing Trypsin/P to behave like Trypsin)

## [v0.13.2]
### Changed
- Subtle change to TMT integration tolerance, and selection of which ion to quantify (most intense). As a result, TMT integration should be more in agreement (if not 100% so) with ProteomeDiscover/FragPipe/etc
- Remove `delta_mass` (precursor ppm) LDA feature - instead, build a delta mass (or ppm) profile using KDE/posterior error calculation code, and use the P(decoy) as a feature for LDA.

## [v0.13.1]
### Changed
- Internal performance and stability improvements for RT prediction & LDA

## [v0.13.0]
### Added
- Better error reporting thanks to @Elendol
- Added support for multiple variable mods for the same amino acid
- Added support for N/C-terminal modifications specific to an individual amino acid

New syntax:
```json
"variable_mods": {
    "M": [15.9949],
    "^Q": -17.026549,
    "^E": -18.010565,
    "[": 42.010565
}
```

Either a single floating point number (-18.0) or a list of floating point numbers ([-18.0, -15.2]) can be supplied as modifications. Support for single values may eventually be phased out to simplify the parser.

### Changed
- Changed "_fdr" columns to "_q" (e.g. "spectrum_q") in "results.sage.tsv" file
- Changed internal data representation of `Peptide` struct to allow for sharing of sequences (using `Arc`) among modified peptides
- Fragment index creation should now be faster

## [0.12.0]
### Added
- Add `wide_window` option to configuration file. This option turns off `precursor_tol`, instead using the isolation window written in the mzML file.
### Changed
- Changed internal calculation of precursor tolerances when searching with `isotope_errors`. The new version should be more accurate. This change also enables a significant boost to search speed for open searches.

## [0.11.2]
### Added
- Add rank & charge features to LDA
### Changed
- One-hot encode charge state information for percolator `.pin` files
- Change PSMId -> SpecId for Mokapot compatibility with `.pin` files

## [0.11.1]
### Added
- Support for additional fragment ion types, via the "database.ion_kinds" configuration option. Valid values are "a", "b", "c", "x", "y", "z"
### Changed
- Sort protein names alphanumerically for each peptide entry. This should enhance stability across runs, and fixes a bug with picked-protein group FDR
- Fix another bug where picked-FDR approaches assume internal decoy generation

### Changed
- Modify order of operations during deisotoping. Deisotoped peaks can contribute intensity to only 1 parent peak now, rather than potentially multiple parent peaks

## [0.11.0]
### Added
- Support for percolator output files (`--write-pin` CLI flag)
- Support for modifying file batch size (`--batch-size N` CLI flag)
- Add `delta_best` feature, which reports the delta hyperscore from the best match to current ranked PSM
- Add Sage version to `results.json` files

### Changed
- Breaking changes to `quant` section of the configuration file format
- Rename `delta_hyperscore` to `delta_next`
- Altered internal scoring algorithm. Rather than consider all MS2 peaks within a m/z tolerance window to be matches to a theoretical spectrum, consider only the closest peak. This should increase the accuracy of # of matched peaks, and subsequent scores
- Overhaul of chimeric scoring, `report_psms` can now be used to search for multiple chimeric spectra
- Completely overhauled the LFQ algorithm: added match-between runs, peak scoring using normalized spectral angle relative to theoretical isotopic envelope, target decoy scoring of MS1 integration
- Fixed bug in picked-peptide FDR that could lead to liberal FDR
- Fixed bug in picked-protein FDR that could lead to conservative FDR
- Fixed bug where using variable protein terminal (e.g. protein N-terminal acetylation) modifications could cause some determinism. This also improves the accuracy of peptide => protein assignment. Unfortunately this fix has performance implications, causing creation of the fragment index to take up to ~2x as long.

### Removed
- Remove `no-parallel` CLI flag, and `parallel` configuration file entry

## [0.10.0]
### Added
- Retention times are now globally aligned across files
- RT prediction is then performed on all files at once (on aligned RTs), rather than one file at a time - previously, there were many instances where some files in a search could not have RTs predicted, decreasing the effectiveness of delta_rt as a feature for LDA.

### Changed
- Peptide sequences within a protein are now deduplicated - previously, repeated peptides would be called multiple times for the same protein (e.g. num_proteins > 1 even if the peptide was unique)

## [0.9.4]
### Changed
- Fix issues with RT prediction (and occasionally LDA) that arise from 0's being present on the diagonals of the covariance matrix (small amount of regularization added)

## [0.9.3]
### Added
- Allow users to set minimum number of matched b+y ions for reporting PSMs (`min_matched_peaks`)

### Changed
- Internal code for calculating factorials

## [0.9.2]
### Added
- Added option for TMT signal/noise quantification, if noise values are present in mzML

## [0.9.1]
### Changed
- FASTA file path, JSON configuration file can now be specified as "s3://" paths, allowing Sage to run completely disk-free

## [0.9.0]
### Added
- Support for non-specific digests, N-terminal enzymatic digestion

## [0.8.1]
### Added
- `quant.tmt_level` configuration option to enable MS2 (or MSn) isobaric quantification

## [0.8.0]
### Added
- Support for protein N-terminal ('['), C-terminal (']') as well as peptide C-terminal ('$') modifications
- Support for k-combinations of variable modifications. This can be specified with the `database.max_variable_mods` parameter

## [0.7.1] - 2022-11-04
### Changed
- Fix bug with in silico digest: Logic around overwriting decoys with target sequences was incorrect peptides shared between targets/decoys were being annotated as decoy peptides but assigned to non-decoy proteins. We now make sure that they are assigned to non-decoy proteins and also annotated as target sequences.

## [0.7.0] - 2022-11-03
### Added
- Add support for user-specified enzymes to JSON file.  `database.enzyme.sites` and `database.enzyme.restrict` are limited to valid amino acids
- Sage can now search MS2 spectra without annotated precursor charge states. Default behavior is to search with z=2, z=3, z=4, and then merge the PSMs for scoring

### Changed
- Configuration file schema changed. `peptide_min_len`, `peptide_max_len`, `missed_cleavages` are now specified under `database.enzyme` in the JSON file
- Internal behavior of Sage was changed to enable deterministic searching
- Docker file changed from Alpine to Debian


## [0.6.0] - 2022-11-01
### Added
- Changelog
- `rank` column added to output file
- `database.generate_decoys` parameter, which turns off internal decoy generation. This enables the use of FASTA databases for SearchGUI/PeptideShaker

### Changed
- Base ProForma v2 notation is used for peptide modifications, i.e. "\[+304.2071\]-PEPTIDEM\[+15.9949\]AAC\[+57.0214\]H"
- `scannr` column now contains the full nativeID/spectrum title from the mzML file, i.e. "controllerType=0 controllerNumber=1 scan=30069"
- `discriminant_score` column renamed to `sage_discriminant_score` for PeptideShaker recognition
- `database.decoy_prefix` JSON option changed to `database.decoy_tag`. This allows decoy tagging to occur anywhere within the accession: "sp|P01234_REVERSED|HUMAN"
- Output file renamed:  `results.pin` to `results.sage.tsv`
- Output file renamed: `quant.csv` to `quant.tsv`
- Rename `pin_paths` to `output_paths` in results.json file


## [0.5.1] - 2022-10-31

## [0.5.0] - 2022-10-28
### Added

### Changed

- Additional parallelization for assignment of PEP, FDR, writing output files

## [0.4.0] - 2022-10-18
